This is my first git project.
I am still learning about python package and module rules so it may be a bit badly structured.
Will clean it up as i learn more.





This has two entry points.

CRAWL_FACEBOOK.py
	This crawls facebook with a given seed id and maps relations between people
FbGun.py
	This shoots of the text in message.txt to all available profiles in data by a
	layered approach using the seed ID
plotter.py
	This plots relations in facebook between people.
	Plots the entire map.
The data folder contains a few IDs I have mapped in the past few days.
My internet is slow so excuse the spordaic git pushes.

Will keep on improving as far as i can.
